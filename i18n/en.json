  "HOMEMAIN1" : "RESABIKE.CH is a project aimed at making life easier for cyclists traveling by public transport on regional lines. So we are mainly talking about buses and other postal buses, especially in tourist areas! The idea being that it is more pleasant for everyone (operator, driver, traveler ...) to know how many cyclists wish to travel with their horses. This makes it possible to foresee as much as possible the trailers to be coupled, or to announce to the travelers that the carrier is already well filled.",

  "MAINABOUT2" : "The trailers specially designed for the transport of the bicycles, combined with the reservation system, make it possible to best satisfy the needs of the bikers ...",
  "MAINABOUT3" : "More and more bookings are arriving for other lines than those of the Val d'Anniviers. It was then that the idea of ​​creating a website to book races for regions other than central Valais sprang up. Statistics of attendance can be easily established ...",
